How to contribute
=================

## Workspace and using

### Directly on GitHub editor

Assuming you are in the GitHub project allowed contributors, you 
can use github's internal editor and make small changes quickly. 


### Run locally

It requires Ruby on rails on your local machine.

On a terminal, run:

    bundle install

It will take care of the dependencies, then, to run the local copy:

    bundle exec jekyll serve
